## Usage Instructions :

- Download the contents of The Repository as a Zip File or clone the Repository.
- Install Python in your Machine 
- Run the safe.py file by running <i>python safe.py</i> or <i>python3 safe.py</i> on it.
- Then add your spare username and email from which you want to send the emails to your own email if you want to reset the password (on line numbers 202 and 204 in the safe.py file). Make sure to allow access of using less secure apps in that particular email. Check the tutorial here: https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/secure-app-gmail/
